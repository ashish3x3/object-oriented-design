How Hashmap works




key HashCode() -> hash value used to calculate bucket

1 hash table of buckets
n linkedlist of nodes per bucket .. each node has key, value and pointer to next node in bucket



How is hahmap consructed by default


default value of DEFULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY is 16 in hashmap 
number of buckets as power f 2


default valueof load factro is .75
if exceded--hash table buckets are ncread by x*2 and all buckets refreshed



What is ahash function
hascode() function ehich returns an integer value, used by hashmap to find a correct bucket


what is a hashmap bucket
used simple linked lst to stpre objcts

cam have multiple ly-value apirs

Map.Entry  == hash,key,value, NextNodereferecen



How does Hashmap get(key K) method works

checks whether key is null or not (only one nul key possible)
calls hasCode emthos on the key object
appies returnd hashValue to itsownstatsic hash functio(it defends against poor qulity hasg function) to find a bucket location(backing array)

if in single bucket 2 entries ahs same hash vakue--then uses key.equals()




How does put(k,v) work?

by definition, the put command replaces th revious vale associatedd wththr goven key in the map




What is HasCode colliosn
two diff objet prodcu ewqaul hascode

Difference beteeen HashTabea dn HAshMap

hashtable is synchronized while hashmap is not
hashtable dose nt allow null key values.hahmap allow one null key value andmany null vlaues

oneof the Hashmap cubclases is linkedHashMap, so in the eevent that you want predictable iteration order(whic is insertioj order byd efault), yu could easily sqap out the hashmap fr linked hashMap

This wouldn;t be easu if U use hasjtabel

ConcurrentHashMap -- thread safe chec then act semantics such as
	ConcurrentMap.putIfAbsent(key,value);
