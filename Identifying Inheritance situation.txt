Object-oriented design: Identifying an inheritance situation

anything which depects IS_A relationhip is a inheritance candidate

A car IS_A vehicle
A bus IS_A vehicle
AN employee IS_A person
A customer IS_A person
A checking/saving account IS_A kind of bank account



Wrong relationship
A car IS_A bus
A customer IS_A shopping cart

Composition example HAS_A
Bank HAS_A bank account..not inheritance


Any framework use inheritance extensively. bcz all wants to provide generic functionalty rathe than writin specfic one.
for example in JAVA there is fileDialog class wich inherits from..

FILEDIALOG <--- DIALOG <--- WINDOW <--- CONTAINER <--- COMPONENT <--- OBJECT
